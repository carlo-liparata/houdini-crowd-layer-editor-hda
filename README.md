# houdini-crowd-layer-editor-hda
This is a houdini digital asset to edit layers of agents.
My hda is based on the crowd assign layers sop, it has a python viewer state to make it viewport interactive, by clicking in the viewport on the agent to edit.
It saves every edit as a crowd assign layers node so it makes it easier to turn on/off every edit.
